# StartupML Workshop â€“ May 12, 2016

Welcome to the **StartupML Workshop** held on May 12, 2016, led by Justin Lent. This workshop focuses on the application of machine learning techniques in quantitative finance, with practical examples using the Zipline backtesting library.

## Contents

- **Zipline_simple_example.ipynb**: A Jupyter notebook demonstrating a simple example of using Zipline for backtesting trading strategies. The notebook covers the basics of algorithmic trading workflows, data handling, and performance analysis.
- **StartupML_05_12_2016_Justin Lent_PPT_slides.pdf**: The official presentation slides from the workshop, providing an overview of key concepts, methodologies, and practical insights into machine learning in finance.

## Purpose

This folder is intended for participants and learners interested in:
